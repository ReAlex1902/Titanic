The goal of the project is to understand either the passenger of the Titanic will die or not. The dataset is here (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

The Scikit Learn library is used in this project.

Firstly, in Analysis.ipynb I'm analyzing the data I have. During the work I got that best methods I can use to determine the goal feature are Logistic Regression and Random Forest. Also, I concluded that scaling may be needed.

Then in the main.ipynb I created models and fitted them. And as I expected, Logistic Regression worked perfect, Random Forest was just a little bit (1,6%) worse than Logistic Regression.
